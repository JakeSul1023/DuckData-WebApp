🦆 Waterfowl Migration Prediction System (Duck Data)
Overview

This project aims to predict and visualize waterfowl migration patterns across the Mississippi Flyway using historical data and real-time weather conditions. The system will generate a static CSV file with predictions, which can be used to analyze migration trends over a 10-day forecast period.

Developed in collaboration with the TTU Wildlife Department, this project is being built for Dr. Cohen to assist in tracking and predicting waterfowl movement.
Current Features

✅ Interactive Heatmap – Displays historical migration data using deck.gl and OpenStreetMap
✅ Data Processing Pipeline – Handles raw migration records and prepares them for analysis
✅ Static CSV Generation – Stores structured migration data for further research
Upcoming Goals

🚀 Machine Learning Model – A predictive model will be developed to forecast migration patterns up to 10 days in advance
🌦 Weather Data Integration – NOAA weather data will be used as a key factor in migration predictions
📊 Time-Slider Feature – Allows users to step through historical migration data over time
🖥 High-Performance Computing (HPC) – The ML model will be optimized and run on TTU’s HPC system for large-scale predictions
How It Will Work

1️⃣ Historical Data Processing – Migration records from TTU Wildlife Department will be preprocessed
2️⃣ Weather-Based Predictions – The ML model will predict duck movements based on current weather conditions
3️⃣ Heatmap Visualization – The React frontend will display past and predicted migrations as a heatmap
4️⃣ CSV Output – The system will generate a predicted migration dataset for further use
